# London Housing Market: Behind the Price Tag, Affordable housing and Social inequality.

Description
This project aims to analyze the evolution of house prices in London from 1995 to 2022 and explore the economic and social issues that have shaped the city's housing market. By comparing the top 3 most expensive and least expensive boroughs in London, the project highlights the lack of housing supply, the imbalance between investment and residential properties, and the struggle of young people to get onto the property ladder. The project also examines some macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation, and earnings.

Installation
The project uses data downloaded from the London Data Store on monthly average prices, sales volume, and house price index, yearly earnings, jobs, jobs density, dwellings, dwelling density, recycling rate, and well-being indicators such as happiness, life satisfaction, worthwhile, anxiety, etc. The CSV files were uploaded to Google Drive, and the data was accessed and analyzed using Google Colab.

Usage
The project is for read-only purposes and aims to showcase the author's data analysis and visualization skills. The Google Collab Notebook used in the project can be viewed directly on GitHub, and the data sources used in the project are linked in the notebook.

Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by Sidney Trengove's project, who also used data from the London Data Store, but analyzed the data differently using different tools.
